# 🚀 File Upload Assignment

> **Where files meet their destiny** ✨

A sleek, modern file upload application that demonstrates the beautiful marriage between a lightning-fast React frontend and a robust FastAPI backend.

## 🎯 What's This About?

This is a full-stack file upload application built as an assignment project. Users can drag, drop, and upload files through an elegant interface, while the backend handles them with grace and efficiency.

### ✨ Features

- **Instant Upload Feedback**: Real-time loading indicators that keep users in the loop
- **Beautiful UI**: Clean, modern design with smooth animations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error messages when things don't go as planned
- **CORS-Ready**: Pre-configured to work seamlessly between frontend and backend

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React 19** - The latest and greatest
- **Vite (Rolldown)** - Lightning-fast build tooling
- **Vanilla CSS** - Because sometimes simple is elegant

### Backend
- **FastAPI** - Modern Python web framework
- **Uvicorn** - ASGI server for blazing speed
- **Python Multipart** - File upload handling

## 🏃 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (for the frontend)
- Python 3.7+ (for the backend)
- A virtual environment (recommended)

### Quick Start

**1. Start the Backend** 🐍
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

**2. Start the Frontend** ⚛️
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

**3. Open Your Browser** 🌐
Navigate to `http://localhost:5174` and start uploading!

```

## 🎨 How It Works

1. **User selects a file** through the sleek file input
2. **Frontend validates** and displays a loading indicator
3. **File is sent** to the backend via POST request
4. **Backend processes** the file (with a 2-second delay to showcase the loading state)
5. **Success message** appears with file details

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### `POST /upload`
Upload a file to the server.

- **Request**: `multipart/form-data` with file field
- **Response**: `{"status": "success", "filename": "...", "size": ...}`
- **Interactive Docs**: Visit `http://localhost:8000/docs` for Swagger UI

## 💡 Development Notes

- Frontend runs on port **5174** (or 5173 if available)
- Backend runs on port **8000**
- Hot reload is enabled for both frontend and backend
- CORS is configured to allow localhost origins

## 🎓 Learning Points

This project demonstrates:
- ✅ Full-stack application architecture
- ✅ React hooks (`useState`, async handling)
- ✅ FastAPI async endpoints
- ✅ File upload handling
- ✅ CORS configuration
- ✅ Modern frontend tooling (Vite/Rolldown)
- ✅ Loading states and user feedback

## 🚨 Common Issues

**CORS Errors?**
Make sure the backend's `allow_origins` includes `http://localhost:5174`

**Backend won't start?**
Check that port 8000 isn't already in use

**Frontend shows blank page?**
Verify the backend is running and accessible
